"""Check that the packages a screen builds from fit together (app 0.2.84+; tools/check.sh runs this).

A screen is packages/core.yaml plus one board file under packages/boards/, included by an entry file: packages/<board>.yaml
for a screen that builds over GitHub, <profile>.yaml in the repository root for a build from a checkout. This checks what
ESPHome would only tell one build at a time:

- every entry names files that exist, and the published entry and the checkout entry of a board include the same two;
- nothing under packages/ carries a secret, a local component path or a fixed Home Assistant subscription: a screen
  gets its values from ESP Screen Manager while it runs, and its keys from its own YAML;
- every ${NAME} the shared core uses is defined, and every board defines the same names: a new board file that
  forgets a size or a hook fails here, not in the first build of a user.
